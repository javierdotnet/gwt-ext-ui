The main concept in this project is to make the client side thinner, move the UI definition to the server side.
The server side can decide about autoentication, permissions and data connectivity.

The initial step of the project is to use GWT-EXT so it will have very attractive UI that it's build easily.

A small research that we did proved that this approach reduce the side of the client by more then 50% and also it make the client side more secure.
